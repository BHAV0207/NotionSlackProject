Visualization: Collaborative Editor System
1. Basic Visual Model
Actors (Who’s involved):
Your Browser / Tab (where you see and type into the editor)

Other Users’ Browsers (they run the same code, in their tabs)

The Server (a “mailman” for WebSocket messages)

Core Components

2. Step-by-Step Flow
A. You Type in TipTap
When you type or format text (bold, italic, etc), TipTap dispatches changes to the local editor state.

B. Changes Stored in Yjs Document
Y.Doc acts like a live document in your browser.

When the editor changes, Yjs records the update in its memory.

C. Yjs Document Emits Update
Yjs detects the change and prepares a “binary update blob” (think: a little zipped up package telling what changed).

D. WebSocket Sends Updates
The binary blob is sent over a WebSocket connection to the server. WebSocket is a special protocol that keeps a door open for constant back-and-forth talk with the server, so everyone in the same document stays in sync.

E. Server Broadcasts Update
The server receives the blob and quickly forwards it to all other users currently viewing that same document.

F. Other Users Receive Update
Each other tab (other user’s browsers) receive the update via their own WebSocket.

Yjs applies those changes to their local document, so everyone’s content stays in sync — even if people type at the same time.

G. UI Updates Instantly
TipTap sees the new changes and re-renders the editor content, so you see other users’ changes “live.”

Block Diagram (Textual)
Here’s another way of viewing it as a network:

text
          ┌───────────────────────────────┐
          │            Server             │
          └───────▲────────┬──────────────┘
                  │        │
            ┌─────┘        └─────┐
      ┌─────────┐       ┌─────────┐
      │Browser A│       │Browser B│
      └────▲────┘       └────▲────┘
           │                 │
        [Y.Doc]————[WebSocket] (each browser)
           │                 │
       [TipTap Editor]   [TipTap Editor]
